    <p>Michael and Michelle’s March Madness was founded in 1985 when a 17-year-old Michael Wu was playing at an AAU basketball tournament in Naperville, Illinois. During his warmup, he was approached by his teammate’s older sister, Michelle Jane, who suggested that Michael should get new shoes, since he was slipping when trying to do layups. Michael then learned that Michelle was a shoe designer and asked if she could design new shoes for him so he could better perform on the court. They began to work together and designed their first line of basketball shoes in December of 1985. From then on, they expanded their product line to a variety of high quality basketball equipment that ensured stability and support for athletes on the court. By the late 90’s, Michael and Michelle’s March Madness had twenty retail locations across the United States.</p>
