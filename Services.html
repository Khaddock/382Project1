<u><h2 style=color:Orange;">Customer Service</h2></u>

<p>Customer service is one of the most important parts of a company and at March Madness, we make sure it is our top priority that every single one of our customers is happy. If a customer is unhappy with a product they received or has any other complaints, we have <b>24-hour customer service</b> available for them to talk about why they are unhappy. They can access the phone number for our customer service by looking on the website. <br>

<u><h2 style=color:Orange;">Rewards Program</h2></u>

We take pride in <b>customer loyalty</b>, so we provide a very beneficial rewards program for our customers. Throughout the rewards program, after a certain number of purchases the customer will be gifted with some sort of reward, such as “<i>50% off your next purchase</i>” or “<i>Buy one pair of shoes, get one free</i>”. By doing this, we feel like this shows our appreciation for the customers that continue to come back and purchase our products.<br> 
 
<u><h2 style=color:Orange;">Online Option</h2></u>

For the convenience of our customers that don’t live by any of our 20 locations, it is very easy to order any of our products online on our website. Our online store is extremely organized making it as easy as possible to find whatever you are looking for. We also offer an option to <b>customize</b> your basketball shoes however you would like.
